After completing each new module, add the APIs to ExpenseIQ_collection.json.

The collection must be updated only after the module is fully completed.

Follow a standard pattern when adding APIs.

Take a reference from the existing collection that already follows the required format.

Add the new APIs in the same standardized manner.
