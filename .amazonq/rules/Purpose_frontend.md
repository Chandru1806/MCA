Throughout the frontend implementation, follow the pattern below:

Maintain correct alignment, spacing, sizes, and overall visual consistency.

Keep a single common style for all popup messages, errors, and alerts.

Do not use Unicode characters on the website.

Provide design ideas before implementing the modules. I will choose a design, and then you can implement that design.
