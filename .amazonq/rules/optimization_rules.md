We need to update all “optimize later” features for every module that we create.

NOTE: Add an entry only if there is something that needs to be optimized, mentioning the module name and the specific feature.
If there is nothing to optimize, simply state: “The correct module has been created.”


## PDF Upload Module

**Optimize later:**
- Auto-detection logic for bank_name is not working properly. Currently using manual bank selection as workaround. Need to fix detect_bank() function to properly identify HDFC, KOTAK, SBI, ICICI, AXIS, CUB, IDFC from PDF patterns.

## Transaction Categorization Module
